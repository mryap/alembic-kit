## Available for Hire

I use [data pipelines](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjP05TxqdnhAhXSuHEKHbHGAf0QjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40sarthakg%2Fbuilding-a-data-pipeline-on-gcp-noob-edition-34ce0df49380&psig=AOvVaw2-cX2bjvNs8wzTPm4mQXxd&ust=1555666074030566) and [data products](https://rstudio.cloud) that are already created to do data science work. I used existing algorithm to solve business proble. I am not a good fit if you are seeking someone to create a whole new algorithm to solve your business problems. (By the way, are you sure your business problem need a new algorithm for problem solving?)

## My approach to data analytics

Data analytics combines knowledge of customer with their larger patterns of activity and behaviour. Then combine that knowledge with the broader patterns that affect client business—geography, demography, weather, social media activity, competition or anything else you need—to get a more complete picture of their target audience.

Today's consumer journey is multi-channel and multi-device. You need consumer insights from a variety of connected data sources to form a comprehensive view of the groups being analyzed. The insights offered must derived from real consumer data and not just being inferred if possible. Data is only as powerful as client ability and capacity to act on it. By focusing on key metrics - i.e. user retention rates, client become data driven.  

### Ensure data is fit for purpose

By auditing Google Analytics setups to establish the quality of the data collected. As the saying goes, garbage in garbage out. My good understanding of UTM parameters ensure every traffic to the site is tagged.

#### Segmentation

I focus on actionable data, or information you can make decisions based on. Segmentation is one key to more actionable insights and optimization opportunities.

#### Granularity

Custom Dimensions add much-needed granularity to Google Analytics data. By including non-standard data in your reports, you can use them to collect and analyze data that Google Analytics doesn't automatically track.
