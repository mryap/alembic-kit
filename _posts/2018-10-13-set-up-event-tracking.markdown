### Google Analytics

To track any events like  button clicks, here the gists of it with Google Tag Manager

1. Find your button, or CTA elements
2. View the source code - What if the button is in a form, but it doesn’t have a class?
3. Enable the variable
4. Create a tag
5. Create a trigger
6. Preview the container
7. Check Google Analytics
8. Publish the container

### Heap Analytics

It auto-tracks every user event. If you want to left no stone unturned, you can point and click all those call-to-action elements visually. The exception is Scroll Tracking where additional JavaScript snippet is require. Forget to track an event? Don’t fret —  you can add this event later and Heap Analytics still be able to give you data. If you hate begging ~~requesting~~ for help because your developers is ALWAYS busy to set up a new Google Analytics tracking on a registration form or a button, Heap Analytics is the one.
