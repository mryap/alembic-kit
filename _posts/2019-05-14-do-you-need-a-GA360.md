Most Google Analytics setups are not customised at all.

And it is a huge mistake.

Google Analytics is the most important tool for optimising your website and digital marketing.

But it should be customised based on your company's strategy, web site and marketing channels.  Otherwise, you are just tracking things Google's engineers thought you should be tracking.

✅ Use custom dimensions for recording qualitative information about hits, users and sessions.

✅ Use custom metrics in addition to standard metrics.

✅ Use content groups based on content topic, category, author or web page template.

✅ Track UI elements like buttons, links and videos with events.

✅ Use monetary goal values instead of just tracking thank you pages.

✅ Create your own channels for campaign tracking.

✅ Import advertising cost data from Facebook and other advertising channels.
 
All of this is available for free Universal Analytics. You don't need a GA360 license - just someone to implement the features.
