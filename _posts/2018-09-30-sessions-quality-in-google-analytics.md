A value closer to 1 indicates a low session quality, or far from transacting, while a value closer to 100 indicates a high session quality, or very close to transacting. A value of 0 indicates that Session Quality is not calculated for the selected time range. 

Under Bigquery, the field is totals.sessionQualityDim

The SQ metrics bring Google’s machine learning capabilities to predict the likelihood of a user making a transaction on a website.  The Google algorithm, based on the selected data sample, learns the process that leads to the declared goal - in this case, e-commerce transactions. Thanks to this, it is able to evaluate a fresh sample of data and assess their potential. Therefore, it is important that the sample is representative. This results in certain minimum requirements, the threshold determined in the case of **Session Quality** is:

- 1000 e-commerce transactions a month
- Maintain this level for the next 30 days
