Browse for a cake last week on mobile devices. Revisit the same site today via search on desktop but struggle to remember which cake I made up my mind on. 

Missed opportunities for the cake shop. Given the deadline tomorrow, I take my chances and will just pop in M&S and order those off-the-shelf cake.

I was thinking: what if this cake shop pop-up a message on my mobile before I exit the site to remind me

- Some cakes takes 5 days in advance to order
- Request my email so I can continue visit the site on desktop
- If I am on Opera browser, offer to send the website link via My Flow
