Google Tag Manager is a robust and full-featured tag management system, which supports Google and 3rd party tags. 

`gtag.js` is just a mini version of Google Tag Manager. `gtag.js` allows you to send data to only Google Marketing Platform (Google Ads, Campaign Manager, Display & Video 360, Search Ads 360, and Google Analytics) 

You just need one snippet per page.
